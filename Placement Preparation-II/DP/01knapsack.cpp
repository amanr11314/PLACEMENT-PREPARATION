/**
 * You are given weights and values of N items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W
 * to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.
 * Note that we have only "one quantity of each item". 
 * In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..N-1] and wt[0..N-1] 
 * which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively. 
 * Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, 
 * find out the maximum value subset of val[] 
 * such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W.
 * You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
