/**
 * Given an array of non-negative integers nums, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
 * Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position. 
 * Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
 * You can assume that you can always reach the last index.
 * 
 * Pretty Easy Greedy Solution if you understand it :p üòÅ
